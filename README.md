# M365DuplicateFileFinder
A .NET library to identify duplicate files stored in Microsoft 365.

Currently, the code can only connect to a consumer OneDrive account. Work accounts support will be added later.

[Program.cs](M365DuplicateFileFinder.Console/Program.cs) contains code for a simple console program showing how to use the library.
